# ODMember

ODMember is a digital loyalty card and stamp card app for a single business. You can self-host the frontend and connect it to your own Supabase project.

All access starts at `/login`. There is no marketplace or multi-tenant public signup flow for businesses.

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI primitives
- React Router
- Supabase Auth, Postgres, Storage, and RPC functions
- Vercel Analytics
- Vercel deployment config via [`vercel.json`](vercel.json)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- A Supabase project

## Local Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

3. Configure `.env.local`:

   Required:
   - `VITE_APP_URL`: your app URL, for example `http://localhost:3001` (same port as `npm run dev`)
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: your [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: your Supabase anon key

   Optional:
   - `VITE_ENABLE_DEMO_WORKSPACE`: set to `true` to enable the demo workspace in development
   - `VITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL`: support email shown in the app

4. Set up the database in the Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```text
   supabase/migration.sql   -> run first for a fresh install
   supabase/seed.sql        -> optional, run second for the local/dev demo admin
   ```

   Notes:
   - [`supabase/migration.sql`](supabase/migration.sql) is the canonical fresh-install script. It includes the current schema, RLS policies, storage policies, and RPC functions.
   - The smaller SQL files in [`supabase/legacy-patches/`](supabase/legacy-patches/) are upgrade or repair scripts for older or existing projects and are not part of the default new-project setup.
   - [`supabase/seed.sql`](supabase/seed.sql) is for local or development environments only because it creates a known demo account.

5. Start the dev server:

   - **Frontend only (Vite):** `npm run dev` — serves the app on port **3001** but does **not** run anything under `api/`.
   - **Frontend + serverless APIs (Bayarcash, etc.):** `npm run dev:vercel` — runs Vite via Vercel’s dev server so `/api/*` handlers in [`api/`](api/) work locally. Requires the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) and a linked project (or `vercel link`) so env vars load from `.env.local`.

   Set `VITE_APP_URL` to match how you open the app (for example `http://localhost:3001`).

## Demo Admin Seed

If you run [`supabase/seed.sql`](supabase/seed.sql), it creates this development-only owner account:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Email | `admin@odmember.local` |
| Password | `Admin1234` |
| Slug | `demo` |

Change the password after first login in `Settings -> Account`.

Do not use the demo seed account as-is in production.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: start the Vite development server (no `/api` routes)
- `npm run dev:vercel`: Vite + local Vercel serverless functions from `api/`
- `npm run generate:sitemap`: regenerate `public/sitemap.xml`
- `npm run build`: regenerate the sitemap, then build the production bundle
- `npm run preview`: preview the production build locally

There is currently no automated test suite in the repo. `npm run build` is the main verification step for this project today.

## Product Notes

- Single-business mode only
- No public business signup flow
- Staff accounts are created by the owner from `Settings -> Staff`
- Public customer-facing routes are supported for viewing issued cards and joining enabled campaigns

## Deploy

You can deploy the app anywhere that serves a Vite SPA, including Vercel.

1. Add the same `VITE_...` environment variables to your deployment platform.
2. If you use Vercel, you can optionally enable Vercel Web Analytics.
3. [`vercel.json`](vercel.json) already rewrites client-side routes to `index.html`.
4. Make sure your Supabase project has already been initialized with [`supabase/migration.sql`](supabase/migration.sql).
